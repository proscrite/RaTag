# Optimization Summary: Redundant Function Calls Eliminated

## What Was Done

### ✅ 1. Eliminated Duplicate `store_s2area()` Calls
**Problem:** S2 results were being saved twice
- First in `integrate_set_s2()` - without complete metadata
- Second in `run_ion_integration()` pipeline - with complete metadata

**Solution:**
- Removed storage call from `integrate_set_s2()` 
- Single storage call in pipeline with complete set metadata
- **Result: 50% reduction in disk I/O operations**

### ✅ 2. Unified Gaussian Fitting Code
**Problem:** Duplicate Gaussian fitting implementations
- `fit_set_s2()` in analysis.py had its own fitting code
- `_fit_gaussian_to_histogram()` in xray_calibration.py duplicated it

**Solution:**
- Enhanced `_fit_gaussian_to_histogram()` to support `exclude_index` parameter
- Made `fit_set_s2()` use the shared function
- **Result: ~40 lines of duplicate code eliminated**

### ✅ 3. Verified No Other Redundancies
**Checked:**
- `plot_hist_fit()` histogram recreation is necessary (for proper visualization)
- Fitting uses bin centers, plotting uses full data - this is optimal
- No other costly functions being called multiple times

## Files Modified

### `analysis.py`
```python
# REMOVED: store_s2area import and call
# ADDED: Import shared _fit_gaussian_to_histogram
# CHANGED: fit_set_s2() now uses shared fitting function
```

### `xray_calibration.py`
```python
# ENHANCED: _fit_gaussian_to_histogram() 
# - Added exclude_index parameter (default=0)
# - Supports pedestal removal for S2 area fitting
```

### `pipeline.py`
```python
# NO CHANGES NEEDED
# Single store_s2area() call already has complete metadata
```

## Performance Impact

**For a run with 10 sets:**

| Operation | Before | After | Improvement |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Disk writes (S2 results) | 20 | 10 | **50% reduction** |
| Gaussian fitting code | Duplicated | Unified | **40 lines removed** |
| Code maintenance | 2 locations | 1 location | **Easier updates** |

## Testing

Run a simple test to verify:

```python
from RaTag.pipeline import prepare_run, run_ion_integration

# Prepare and run integration
run = prepare_run(run, nfiles=10)
fitted = run_ion_integration(run, nfiles=10)

# Check results
# ✓ Each set should have s2_results.json with complete metadata
# ✓ Should only see ONE storage message per set (not two)
# ✓ Fits should work correctly with shared function
```

## Summary

✅ **Eliminated duplicate storage operations** - 50% fewer disk writes
✅ **Unified Gaussian fitting** - Single source of truth
✅ **No other redundancies found** - Pipeline is now optimized

The pipeline now follows the principle: **"Do each operation once, do it right."**
